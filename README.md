# my-pepboard
my-pepboard can be used to draw lines ,rectangles, squares, or any random stuff.
you can use erase option for removing unnecessary elements.
You can also change the size/width and color of the line you draw.
In addition to this you can add a STICKY NOTE to your notes!!

I have used HTML,CSS,JavaScript to build this project.
